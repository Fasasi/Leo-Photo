                    <p class="about-article">When Leo was 12 years old, he got his hands on his first camera. He instantly fell in love. Leo said “What I love the most about my job is that I get to create every day. I capture normal people, regular people. They are not models, they are not actors. They don’t know what to do or how to behave in front of the camera.” He really enjoys helping couples feel good in front of the camera by sharing his passion and educating them about how much they will love the process.</p>
                    <p class="about-article">We work with couples to make sure they get beautiful and well thought out photos to keep as a memory forever. On your special day, you’re going to want a Miami wedding photographer that will help you along your journey. Someone to be there by your side to share their experience and knowledge on how to photograph such an important moment in your life. Leo gets to do what he loves and it shines through his photography.</p>
                    <p class="about-article">We would love to be there with you through every step of your journey. From that exciting first step towards a new life during your proposal to capturing beautiful photos to showcase to your family and friends. Even in today’s world where we are all interconnected at every moment, it is still tough, especially for those closest to you to be a part of every moment. That’s why we’ll show your love and excitement for one another through these photo sessions.</p>
                    <p class="about-article">We’ll work with you on coming up with concepts and ideas for your photos that really put an emphasis on your personality and story. If you’d like to get to know us better before making us your Miami wedding photographer feel free to email or call us. We love meeting new people and getting to tell their story!</p>
